# Bayān

**Bayān** is a writing assistant tailored for **Academic** and **Professional Arabic texts**, designed to ease and elevate the Arabic writing experience. Inspired by tools like the Hemingway Editor, Bayān focuses on **clarity**, **correctness**, and **custom tone analysis** — all optimized for the Arabic language.

---

## 🧭 Project Summary

Bayān empowers Arabic writers by providing:

- **Structural validation** of sentences.
- **Tone and style analysis** for professional and academic writing.
- **Grammar and orthography checks**.
- **Vocabulary suggestions and refinements**.
- **Metrics** that help writers stay within professional or academic standards.

It aims to solve the long-standing issue of the lack of mature, Arabic-centric writing tools that go beyond basic spell checking. Unlike office suites, Bayān is built with **advanced verification**, **caching**, and **user experience** in mind — with modern language technologies at its core.

- Offering real-time feedback tailored to Arabic usage.
- Supporting **structured academic** and **formal professional** tone.
- Providing a **minimalist yet powerful UI** for focused writing.
- Facilitating advanced **validation metrics** for formal users.
